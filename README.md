# -DIWALI-SALES-ANALYSIS
Hello everyone, I am Somnath Das. I'm thrilled to share that I've just completed my second project in Python using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. I designed an engaging dashboard using Python that allows for the monitoring and analysis of the DIWALI SALES ANALYSIS. So, let's dive deep into the project and provide some analysis.

PROJECT LEARNINGS:-
1. PERFORMED DATA CLEANING AND MANIPULATION.
2. PERFORMED EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS(EDA) USING PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB AND SEABORN LIBRARIES.
3. IMPROVED CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE BY IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS ACROSS DIFFERENT STATES, OCCUPATION, GENDER AND AGE GROUPS.
4. IMPROVED SALES BY IDENTIFYING MOST SELLING PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND PRODUCTS, WHICH CAN HELP TO PLAN INVENTORY AND HENCE MEET THE DEMANDS.

INSIGHTS:-
1. FROM GRAPHS WE CAN SEE THAT MOST OF THE BUYERS ARE FEMALES AND EVEN THE PURCHASING POWER OF FEMALES ARE GREATER THAN MEN.
2. FROM THE GRAPHS WE CAN SEE THAT MOST OF THE BUYERS ARE OF AGE GROUP BETWEEN 26-35 FEMALE.
3. IN THIS GRAPHS WE CAN SEE THAT THE MOST OF THE ORDERS AND TOTAL SALES/ AMOUNT ARE FROM UTTAR PRADESH, MAHARASHTA AND KARNATAKA RESPECTIVELY.
4. FROM GRAPHS WE CAN SEE THAT MOST OF THE BUYERS ARE WORKING IT AND AVIATION SECTORS.
5. FROM GRAPHS WE CAN SEE THAT MOST OF THE SOLD PRODUCTS ARE FROM FOOD, FOOTWEAR AND ELECTRONICS CATEGORY.

CONCLUSION:-
MARRIED WOMEN AGE GROUP 26-35 YEARS FROM UP, MAHARASHTA AND KARNATAKA WORKING IN IT, HEALTHCARE AND AVIATION ARE MORE LIKELY BUY PRODUCTS FROM FOOD, CLOTHING AND ELECTRONICS CATEGORY.Hello everyone, I am Somnath Das.
